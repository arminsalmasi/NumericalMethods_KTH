# NumericalMethods_KTH

Course in applies numerical methods


This is a collection of numerical solutions to *ODEs* and *PDEs*.
All problems are exercises in a course in *applied numericla methods*
at *KTH Royal Institute of Technology*, fall 2019.

all codes are in Matlab. Not the most efficient porgramming language 
but that's what the course pm dictates. My intention is to recode all in Fortran and/or Python.
