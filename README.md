# NumericalMethods_KTH

Course in applies numerical methods


This is a collection of numerical solutions to *ODEs* and *PDEs*.
All problems are exercises in a course in *applied numericla method*
at *KTH Royal Institute of Technology*, fall 2019.

all codes are in Matlab. Not the most efficient porgramming language 
but that's what the instruction dictates. I am intending to rewrite all of these 
codes with Fortran and Python. Also I will write a MPI version of all the codes in future.
