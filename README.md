# NumericalMethods_KTH

Course in applies numerical methods


This is a collection of numerical solutions to *ODEs* and *PDEs*.
All problems are exercises in a course in *applied numericla methods*
at *KTH Royal Institute of Technology*, fall 2019.


- ex1: Numerical Solution of Initial Value Problems
- ex2: Numerical Solution of a Boundary Value Problem
- ex3: Partial differential equation of parabolic type
- ex4: Numerical solution of elliptic PDE problems
- ex5: Numerical experiments with hyperbolic PDE problems
- ex6: Iterative methods for linear systems of equations




all codes are in Matlab. Not the most efficient porgramming language 
but that's what the course pm dictates. My intention is to recode all in Fortran and/or Python.
